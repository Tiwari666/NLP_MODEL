This project is trained based on the GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2)-- a transformer-based model, which is one of the most popular architectures for large language models (LLMs).

While GPT-2 is typically used for tasks like text generation, it can also be adapted for tasks like classification through fine-tuning. The key reasons it qualifies as an LLM are its large size (1.5 billion parameters), its transformer-based architecture, and its ability to handle a wide range of NLP tasks.

This is an LLM model because GPT-2 has:

--Large Size: It has 1.5 billion parameters, qualifying it as a large model.

--Pretrained on Massive Data: GPT-2 is trained on vast amounts of text data, learning broad language patterns.

--Transformer Architecture: It uses the powerful transformer model, common in LLMs.

--Generative and Versatile: GPT-2 can generate text and is adaptable for tasks like text classification, which you are using in your project.
